        Returns all defined webhooks for the requesting application.


        This API only returns webhooks that are applied to files or folders that
        are

        owned by the authenticated user. This means that an admin can not see
        webhooks

        created by a service account unless the admin has access to those
        folders, and

        vice versa.
      parameters:
        - name: marker
          description: >-
            Defines the position marker at which to begin returning results.
            This is

            used when paginating using marker-based pagination.


            This requires `usemarker` to be set to `true`.
