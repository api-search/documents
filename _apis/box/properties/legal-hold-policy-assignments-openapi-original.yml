        Get a list of current file versions for a legal hold

        In some cases you may want to get previous file versions instead. In
        these

        cases, use the `GET 
        /legal_hold_policy_assignments/:id/file_versions_on_hold`

        API instead to return any previous versions of a file for this legal
        hold

        policy assignment.


        Due to ongoing re-architecture efforts this API might not return all
        file

        versions held for this policy ID. Instead, this API will only return the

        latest file version held in the newly developed architecture. The `GET

        /file_version_legal_holds` API can be used to fetch current and past
        versions

        of files held within the legacy architecture.


        The `GET /legal_hold_policy_assignments?policy_id={id}` API can be used
        to

        find a list of policy assignments for a given policy ID.

        Legal Hold Assignments are used to assign Legal Hold
        Policies to Users, Folders, Files, or File Versions.

        Creating a Legal Hold Assignment puts a hold
        on the File-Versions that belong to the Assignment's
        'apply-to' entity.
