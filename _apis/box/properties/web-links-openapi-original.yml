                        A password can only be set when `access` is set to

                        specified

                        by the enterprise admin. To create a shared link with
                        this

                        default setting pass the `shared_link` object with

                        no `access` field, for example `{ "shared_link": {} }`.


                        The `company` access level is only available to paid

                        accounts.

                        - collaborators

                        password to `null` to remove it.

                        Passwords must now be at least eight characters

                        long and include a number, upper case letter, or

                        a non-numeric or non-alphabetic character.

                        A password can only be set when `access` is set to
                        `open`.

                    Shared links provide direct, read-only access to files or
                    folder on Box.


                    Shared links with open access level allow anyone with the
                    URL

                    to access the item, while shared links with company or
                    collaborators access

                    levels can only be accessed by appropriately authenticated
                    Box users.
