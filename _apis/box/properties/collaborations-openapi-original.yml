            A comma-separated list of attributes to include in the
            response. This can be used to request fields that are
            not normally returned in a standard response.

            Be aware that specifying this parameter will have the
            effect that none of the standard fields are returned in
            the response unless explicitly specified, instead only
            fields for the mini representation are returned, additional
            to the fields requested.
