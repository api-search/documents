        Returns the web link represented by a shared link.

        A shared web link can be represented by a shared link,
        which can originate within the current enterprise or within another.

        This endpoint allows an application to retrieve information about a
        shared web link when only given a shared link.
      parameters:
        - name: if-none-match

            Ensures an item is only returned if it has changed.

            Pass in the item's last observed `etag` value
            into this header and the endpoint will fail
            with a `304 Not Modified` if the item has not
            changed since.

            A comma-separated list of attributes to include in the
            response. This can be used to request fields that are
            not normally returned in a standard response.

            Be aware that specifying this parameter will have the
            effect that none of the standard fields are returned in
            the response unless explicitly specified, instead only
            fields for the mini representation are returned, additional
            to the fields requested.

        Web links are objects that point to URLs. These objects
        are also known as bookmarks within the Box web application.

        Web link objects are treated similarly to file objects,
        they will also support most actions that apply to regular files.
