        Returns the file represented by a shared link.

        A shared file can be represented by a shared link,
        which can originate within the current enterprise or within another.

        This endpoint allows an application to retrieve information about a
        shared file when only given a shared link.

        The `shared_link_permission_options` array field can be returned
        by requesting it in the `fields` query parameter.

        - name: if-none-match

            Pass in the item's last observed `etag` value
            into this header and the endpoint will fail
            with a `304 Not Modified` if the item has not
            changed since.

            Be aware that specifying this parameter will have the
            effect that none of the standard fields are returned in
            the response unless explicitly specified, instead only

                    and `templateKey`.


                    To access the metadata for a file or folder, first use the

                    metadata endpoints to determine the metadata templates
                    available to your

                    enterprise.


                    Then use the `GET /files/:id` or `GET /folder/:id`

                    endpoint with the `fields` query parameter to get

                    the metadata by ID.


                    To request a metadata instance for a particular `scope` and
                    `templateKey`

                    use the following format for the `fields` parameter:

                    `metadata.<scope>.<templateKey>`

                    to access the item, while shared links with company or
                    collaborators access

                    levels can only be accessed by appropriately authenticated

                        can be downloaded if allowed.
